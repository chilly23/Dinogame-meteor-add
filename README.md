<pre><code># Chrome Dino: Meteor Mode A reimagined version of the classic Chrome Dino game — with a dark twist. When you're offline, everything seems fine. But the moment you go online, a meteor shower falls from the sky to end your run. ![Dino Meteor Demo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1661865487055/sUO3zdyCt.jpg) --- ## Features - **Classic Dino Gameplay** Play as the Dino just like the original Chrome game. - **Online Detection Twist** The game checks your internet status — meteors only spawn if you're online. - **Meteor Showers on Reconnection** If you come back online mid-game, meteors begin falling from the sky to end your run. - **Canvas-Based Animation** Transitions, crash effects, and the “User is Online” message are all rendered on canvas. - **Hardcoded Doom** You cannot dodge the meteors. Once you're online, it's game over — inevitably. --- ## Screenshots | Offline Gameplay | Online Transition | |-------------------------|-----------------------------| | Classic Dino running... | Meteors falling and crashing | --- ## How It Works - When the game starts offline, it behaves just like the original. - After a short delay (e.g., 5 seconds), if you're online, the `meteorsEnabled` flag is triggered. - Meteors begin falling from the top with randomized positions and speed. - After 3 meteor hits, the game ends, showing a custom crash screen that says “User is Online”. </code></pre>
